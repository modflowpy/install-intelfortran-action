[![CI](https://github.com/modflowpy/install-intelfortran-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/modflowpy/install-intelfortran-action/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

An action to install and cache the [Intel OneAPI](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/fortran-compiler.html#gs.bksc2p) Fortran classic compiler via the [HPC Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/hpc-toolkit.html#gs.g10hgy) and add `ifort` to the path.

## Overview

This action installs the [Intel OneAPI](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/fortran-compiler.html#gs.bksc2p) Fortran compiler. It does this by downloading and running the [HPC Toolkit](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/hpc-toolkit.html#gs.g10hgy) offline installer, selecting only the `ifort-compiler` component. After installing the compiler distribution, the action configures [environment variables](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/oneapi-programming-guide/top/oneapi-development-environment-setup.html) necessary to invoke `ifort` from subsequent workflow steps.

## Usage

To use this action, add a step like the following to your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Install Intel Fortran
  uses: modflowpy/install-intelfortran-action@v1
```

## Inputs

- `path`

### `path`

The `path` input is the location to install executables. The path may be absolute, relative to the workflow's working directory, or may use `~`-expansion. The path is resolved and stored in the `INTEL_HPCKIT_INSTALL_PATH` environment variable, which is then available to subsequent workflow steps.

The default install location on Linux and Mac is `~/.local/bin/ifort`. The *only* install location currently supported on Windows is `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI` (see [Windows caveats](#windows-caveats) below).

<!-- ### `version`

The `version` input configures the oneAPI toolkit version to install, defaulting to the latest (currently `2022.3`). 

**Note:** Intel's website does not maintain a programmatically accessible registry of available versions. Moreover, toolkit versioning is distinct from compiler versioning (see [this page] for a mapping between toolkit and compiler versions). For these reasons a list of permitted version numbers are hard-coded into this action. If a new version has been released and this action has not been updated to support it, please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/modflowpy/install-intelfortran-action/issues/new).

### `components`

The `components` input allows specifying extra components to install from the HPC kit. -->

## Environment variables

The action runs oneAPI configuration scripts (e.g. `setvars.sh`), which set a number of environment variables, the names of which share substring `ONEAPI`.

A few additional variables are also set:

- `INTEL_HPCKIT_INSTALL_PATH` points to the top-level install path
- `INTEL_HPCKIT_INSTALLER_URL` is the URL of the installer used
- `INTEL_HPCKIT_COMPONENT` is the compiler component installed (e.g. `intel.oneapi.win.ifort-compiler` for Windows)
- `INTEL_COMPILER_BIN_PATH` is the location of compiler executables (this is equivalent to `$HPCKIT_INSTALL_PATH/compilers/latest/<mac, linux, or windows>/bin/intel64`, substituting the proper OS)
- `INTEL_HPCKIT_VERSION` is the oneAPI HPC toolkit version number used (currently `2022.3`)
- `FC` is set to `ifort`

**Note:** GitHub Actions does not preserve environment variables between steps by default &mdash; this action persists them via the [`GITHUB_ENV` environment file](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#setting-an-environment-variable).

## Windows caveats

There are a few things to be aware of when using this action on Windows runners.

### Shell support

While this action supports all three operating systems, it is currently unable to fully configure the compiler environment for the `bash` shell on Windows &mdash; using `bash` will produce `link: unknown option -- s` errors caused by a failure to find the MSVC linker. Windows runners must either invoke `ifort` from a step using the `cmd` or `pwsh` shell, or add the MSVC bin directory to the path before invoking `ifort` from `bash`, e.g.:

```shell
export PATH="/C/Program Files/Microsoft Visual Studio/2022/Enterprise/VC/Tools/MSVC/14.33.31629/bin/Hostx64/x64":$PATH
```

### Install location

While the HPC toolkit's install location can be selected freely on Linux and Mac, on Windows there is an unresolved issue causing bundled environment configuration scripts [to fail](https://github.com/w-bonelli/install-intelfortran-action/actions/runs/3298296907/jobs/5440222932#step:5:120) when the toolkit is installed to locations other than the default `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI`. Different values for the `path` input are currently ignored for Windows and this location is configured automatically.

<!-- The Intel oneAPI HPC Toolkit installer defaults to different install locations on Unix and Windows if a path is not explicitly provided with the `--install-dir` option:

- Linux/Mac: `/opt/intel/oneapi`
- Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI`

**This action overrides these.** The action's default install location, `~/.local/bin/ifort`, is the same on all three platforms. -->

### Conda `Scripts`

On Windows, this action can stomp on system path configurations set up by `mamba-org/provision-with-micromamba`, causing programs in `<micromamba root>\envs\<your environment name>\Scripts` not to be found when `shell: pwsh` is used. The recommended pattern to avoid this is:

1) use `mamba-org/provision-with-micromamba@main`
2) use `modflowpy/install-intelfortran-action@v1`
3) add a step like the following before any steps expecting to use the Micromamba environment (implemented in Powershell below, but need not be):

```pwsh
# update the path with your environment name
$path = "C:\Users\runneradmin\micromamba-root\envs\<env name>\Scripts"
echo $path | Out-File -FilePath $env:GITHUB_PATH -Encoding utf8 -Append
```
